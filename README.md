# Launch-Control-Center

The goal of LaunchControtCenter (LCC) is to provide an easy to use frontend for event organizers to deploy a cosmos-sdk based blockchain network, to enable value transfers during an event. 

It is part of the launch control project, together with [LaunchControlD](https://github.com/apeunit/LaunchControlD) and [LaunchPayload](https://github.com/apeunit/LaunchPayload). These tools build the technical foundations for the [Eventivize](eventivize.co) project.

While the current functionality is limited to the deployment of the network we plan to extend the utility:
* Deploying necessary applications like event app
* Allow more configuration options
